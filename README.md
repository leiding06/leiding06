## More About Me

Outside of work, Iâ€™m fascinated by shipwrecks and coastal archaeology at risk from erosion. I also love math and logic puzzles, and spend weekends solving problems just for fun. When Iâ€™m not at a desk, youâ€™ll usually find me at the gym 4â€“5 times a week or catching waves in Devon.

Unlike many programmers who started coding in childhood, I took the long way around before discovering this passion. That journey has given me a broader perspective, and I bring that mix of experiences into everything I do.
